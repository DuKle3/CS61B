# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer: My first implementation of hexagon is less hierarchical structure than the TA's live code, and more tactical coding style.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer: the column of hexagon which I use recursion to build which I think is like the wall to Project 3.

-----
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer: I would like to write the route method.

-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: hallway have only one width, and a room are rectangle.
